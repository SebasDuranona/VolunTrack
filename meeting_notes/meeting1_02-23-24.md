### * Brief Introductions

### * Overview of the Project

1. The Project
 Our project will be a dynamic web application to manage and track volunteer hours. The application will allow the roles of:
  - Institution
  - Organization
  - Volunteer <br>
  
This project idea is well suited to the assignment because it allows for a great level of customization, we can make it as complex or as simple as time allows.

2. The Tech Stack

Because we are all familiar with Java, and it is the language we are already using for the course, using a Tech stack that is derivated from Java would be a good fit.
